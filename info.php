<h4>Cornell Activities</h4>
<p> At Cornell one of the main clubs that I am involved in is Global China Connection Cornell branch. It is
a club that is concerned with making Chinese and U.S. culture and business more known to the people of the
respective countries.<br/><br/>
I am also involved in NCPC, a club that puts on activities and programs in North Campus. Some of its main 
events include the All-Niter and the Carnival. <br/><br/><br/>
</p>

<h4>Family</h4>
<p> My family (made up of my mom, my dad and my brother) live in Beijing, China. 
My little bother (sorry, brother) is called Jack, and he is 12 years old 
this year. <br/><br/>
Some of my extended family from my father's side also live in Beijing and we see them often. Relatives
from my mother's side live in Shenyang (a little city not far from Beijing). <br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
